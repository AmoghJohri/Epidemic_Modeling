# Final Project

The goal of this project was to understand compartmental models (precisely SIR and SEIR) for modeling and simulation of COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we went through text-books, prior literature, etc., to gain an in depth understanding of both the modeling methodologies, its nuances, and learned how to create custom models and modify them. <br> Furthermore, we modeled the COVID-19 pandemic for the population of India (in the duration of March 1 2021 - April 21 2021), fine-tuned it to fit real-world data, and provided custom modifications for various scenarios and their possible impact on the pandemic's dynamics. <br> All the code was written in python, and has been written by us. We have purposely avoided the use of libraries (for example to solve differential equations, create and fit mechanistic models, etc.) as the purpose of this exercise was to learn and apply the numerical methods, modeling and simulation techniques that we have learned through the course. Hence, the entire code for modeling and simulation, all the numderical methods employed, all the optimizations, etc., have been written by us from scratch. The only libraries that we have used are 'numpy' and 'matplotlib' for array operations and plotting figures. All the code and the report is contained within this directory itself.
